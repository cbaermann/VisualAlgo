# VisualAlgo

VisualAlgo is an application built to help individuals visualize sorting algorithms. This was built using Angular,
Typescript, and P5. The user can choose one of the many predetermined sorting algorithms where it will input a randomized array.
Upon hitting the run button the user will get to see the array being sorted, using color coded visualizers to aid in the
understanding of the specific algorithm. The user can then randomize the array again and continue to watch the sort as many times
as they would like.
