    <h3> About VisualAlgo</h3>
    <div class="information">
        <p>VisualAlgo was designed by Cody Baermann and Ryan Baermann as a final culminating project. We realized that while developers were able to write their sorting algorithms, they often had a difficult time visualizing how the algorithm would work. This application is built using Angular, Typescript, P5, HTML and CSS.</p>
